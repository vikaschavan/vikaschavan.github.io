On these sites, I will blog on software development for high energy physics (my PhD thesis),
data science and python (my hobby) and everything related to this.

As one of the most famous physicists has once put it:

> Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter.
> Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”
--- Richard Feynman

Let's start our exploration!

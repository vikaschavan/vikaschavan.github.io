Have you ever worked with time series data or sequences?

Think of server logs, medical data of EEGs, production data in Industrie 4.0 environments, ...

Extracting features and finding patterns to be used for classification or regression
can be a quite challenging and time consuming task. This is especially true, as this needs
 much manual work from experts with a lot of domain knowledge.

Our developed package tsfresh frees your time spend on feature extraction by using a large catalog
of automatically extracted features, known to be useful in time series machine learning tasks.
Additionally, it can rank them by their significance and throw out features without useful information.

Learn more about it in our [documentation](http://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or visit our
[project page](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/) on github!

Using tsfresh, you can automize your time series classification, find anomalies in your timely annotated data
easily and also have some fun with financial data...

I will cover all this from a data science as well as a python developer point of view in this blog in the next time.
Stay tuned :smile:
